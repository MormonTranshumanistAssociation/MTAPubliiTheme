# MTAPubliiTheme

Note that Publii doesn't seem to like dashes in its theme folder structure, so we used CamelCase.

## Setting up Publii 
- Download and install [Publii](https://getpublii.com/download/)
- Download [Google Drive for Desktop](https://support.google.com/drive/answer/7329379). If you are on a Mac, be sure you have MacOS High Sierra or newer.
